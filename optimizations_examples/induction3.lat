# Two of the major challenges in implementation.
# The loopâ€™s induction variable is modified within the loop body, among other assignments.
# Additionally, the derived induction variables depend on other derived variables (not only on `n`).
# The dependency flow between the induction variables requires a specific order of initialization.
